# 🎓 Student Registration System

A simple and effective web-based application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and **view** student records dynamically. All data is saved locally using the browser’s `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even after the page reloads.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Users can click **Edit** to modify existing data, or **Delete** to remove a student.
- The data remains saved in the browser until manually cleared.
